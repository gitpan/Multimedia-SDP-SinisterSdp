Changelog for Multimedia::SDP::SinisterSdp:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[0.45]
----------------------------------------,
Gave every routine and every structure defined in the SinisterSdp.xs file a
"SDPXS_" prefix.

A dependency mechanism has been introduced. This enables methods to return
references to internal objects, and ensures that they won't be destroyed until
you are done with them. (You can write a routine that, for example, returns a
reference to an inernal object, and even though the container has gone out of
scope, the internal object wont be destroyed until it too goes out of scope.)


[0.37]
----------------------------------------,
Fixed linked list to array conversion.


[0.35]
----------------------------------------,
Initial release.
