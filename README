1) INTRODUCTION

This Perl extension module provides a front-end to SinisterSdp, an open source
C library for parsing and generating session descriptions.

Multimedia::SDP::SinisterSdp is organized into two main subsystems: a parser
class and a generator class, which allow you to parse SDP descriptions into
objects and generate them programmatically, respectively.

2) INSTALLATION

You'll need to install SinisterSdp at some point. You might want to do this now
on your own, or Makefile.pl can go and try to do it for you. SinisterSdp can be
obtained from SourceForge.net: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sinistersdp/

To install this module, run the following commands:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test
 $ make install

3) GETTING STARTED
